# 🌐 BCG Generative AI Virtual Internship Simulation

Welcome to the repository for the **Boston Consulting Group's Generative AI Virtual Internship Simulation**. This project demonstrates how AI can assist in financial data analysis and chatbot development using real-world company filings.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project is divided into two key tasks:

### ✅ Task 1: Financial Data Analysis
- Manual extraction of financial metrics from **10-K filings** (Microsoft, Apple, Tesla) sourced from the **SEC EDGAR** database.
- Key metrics analyzed:
  - Total Revenue
  - Net Income
  - Total Assets
  - Total Liabilities
  - Cash Flow from Operating Activities
- Data processed using Python and visualized to identify multi-year trends.
- 📂 **Note:** The 10-K filings and processed data can be found in the `Data/` folder of this repository.

### 🤖 Task 2: Chatbot Rule Development
- Designed and implemented **IF-THEN rules** to simulate chatbot logic.
- Rules focused on financial guidance based on extracted metrics and trends.
- Deployed a simple chatbot interface using **Streamlit**.
